Please each of us lets make sure the rest of this code is not using any prohibited Lisp functions, macros, operators, and constants in our 
definitions (Particulary the last and final method)

We should also each make sure we run it on our machines so it works on everyones environment in case Professor Le runs our code on his machine.

****** We were first able to get the correct output but we had been using a prohibited function "dolist", which we were able to cirmcumvent by looping for "foo in range x"

****** We were recieving a stack overflow because I initially had boolean-eval recursively calling itself over and over again but everything now appears to be in-line after
deleting the redundant call to itself.
